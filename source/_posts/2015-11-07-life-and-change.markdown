很多人说过，married couple千万不要去看《革命之路》，因为看完之后两个人会冷战然后反思婚后生活是否如自己所愿，然后发现一团糟，于是继续冷战或者选择离开。。。


我是冲着铁达尼号的“原配”高颜值去看的，结果这对帅哥靓女倒是给我了惊喜。革命之路是部好片子，可能剧情稍微有点波澜不惊，但是传达的思想绝对有深度~！关于生活，关于理想，关于改变....  

这里纪录下经典台词，也是引起我内心共鸣的地方。

Frank: My old man worked at Knox. He was a salesman in Yonkers. Once a year he used to take me into the city for lunch. It was supposed to be a special, life-advice sort of occasion. Not really... I used to sit there and think, I hope to Christ I don't end up like you.' And here I am, a thirty year old Knox man. Can you beat that?  
弗兰克：我老爸为Knox做过事情。他是扬克斯的一个销售人员。每一年他把我带到城里去吃一次饭。是那种很特别的，他给我一点生活建议的场合。结果却不是。我就坐在那儿心想：“我发誓我可不要跟你一个下场。”现在看看我，而立之年耶不过就是一个Knox的员工。多讽刺。 
  
  

APRIL: I think it's unrealistic for a man with a fine mind to go on working like a dog year after year at a job he can't stand, coming home to a place he can't stand, to a wife who's equally unable to stand the same things. You want to know the worst part? Our whole existence here is based on this great premise that we're somehow very special and superior to the whole thing, and you know what I've realized...? We're not! We're just like everyone else. Look at us! We've bought into the same ridiculous delusion. This idea that you have to resign from life and settle down the moment you have children. And we've been punishing each other for it.  
爱普莉：在我看来，现在的生活才叫不现实。让一个有着聪明才智的男人成年累月做牛做马地从事着难以容忍的工作，回家就要面对着难以容忍的环境，伴着个同样难以忍受所有这一切的妻子。你知道最可怕的是什么吗？我们这样的生活状态，完全是基于当初远大的期望，以为自己与众不同，出类拔萃。但是你知道我明白了些什么？我们压根不是那样的。我们就和其他所有人一样。瞧瞧我们俩。我们就此陷入了同样荒谬的幻想。以为我们一有了小孩，就不得不放弃自己的生活，安居乐业，举步不前。但为此我们却彼此惩罚着对方。 
          
  
APRIL: listen to me: It's what you are that's being stifled here. It's what you are that's being denied and denied and denied in this kind of life. Don't you know...? You're the most beautiful and wonderful thing in the world... You're a man.  
爱普莉：听我说：真正的你在这里被压抑了。真正的你被这样的生活一而再再而三地否定。你不知道么？你是这世上最美轮美奂、最奇妙无比的造物⋯⋯你是个男人。   
  

FRANK: Jesus, their faces! You know what this is like, April? Talking like this? The whole idea of taking off to Europe this way? It's like the way I felt going up to the line the first time, in the war. I was probably just as scared as everyone else, but inside I never felt better. I felt alive. I felt full of blood. And everything looked more real. The guys in their uniforms. The snow on the fields, the trees. And all of us just... walking. I mean I was scared of course. But I kept thinking: this is it. This is the truth.  
弗兰克：老天，瞧他们的表情！知道这像什么吗，爱普莉？像这样子说话？像这样远赴欧洲？就像打仗的时候，我第一次上前线。我大概和别人一样心里发憷，不过心底我却感觉很好。我觉得生机勃勃，热血沸腾。所有的一切都那么真实。穿着制服的小伙子。田野上的皑皑白雪，那些树。我们就只是⋯⋯大踏步前进。我是说我当然怕得要死了。可是我却一直在想：就该是这样。生活就该是这样
