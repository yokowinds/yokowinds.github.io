<p>Me and Mrs. Jones,
we got a thing going on,
We both know that it&rsquo;s wrong
But it&rsquo;s much too strong to let it cool down now.
We meet ev'ry day at the same cafe,
Six-thirty I know she&rsquo;ll be there,
Holding hands, making all kinds of plans
While the jukebox plays our favorite song.
Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones,
Mrs. Jones got a thing going on,
We both know that it&rsquo;s wrong,
But it&rsquo;s much too strong to let it cool down now.
We gotta be extra careful that we don&rsquo;t build our hopes too high
Cause she&rsquo;s got her own obligations and so do I,
Me, me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones,
Mrs. Jones got a thing going on,
We both know that it&rsquo;s wrong,
But it&rsquo;s much too strong to let it cool down now.
Well, it&rsquo;s time for us to be leaving,
Iit hurts so much, it hurts so much inside,
Now she&rsquo;ll go her way and I&rsquo;ll go mine,
But tomorrow we&rsquo;ll meet the same place, the same time.
Me and Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones.
we got a thing going on
We gotta be extra careful that we can&rsquo;t build our hopes too high
I want meet and talk with you at the same place,
at the same caffe,at the same time
and we gonna hold hands like we used to
we gonna talk it over,talk it over
we know,they know and you know and I know it&rsquo;s wrong</p>
